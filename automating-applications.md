# Uploading a Blueprint

Uploading a blueprint is the first step for using a blueprint with Cloudify. This can be done using the [REST API upload call](http://www.cloudifysource.org/cosmo-rest-docs/#!/manager-rest-0.1-spec.json/upload_post_1).
Once uploaded, you can create deployements and run workflows on the deployements
