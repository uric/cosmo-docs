## Architecture Overview and flow

## REST API & UI
Cloudify is controlled via REST API. The REST API covers all Cloudify functionality. See [Cloudify REST API Documentation](http://www.blabla.org/docs).
You can use the REST API through Cloudify Non-interactive CLI or write your own REST client.

Cloudify commercial edition comes with Web GUI. The Web GUI works vs. the REST API but adds additional value and visibility.

The GUI has the following screens:
* Blueprints screen
* Blueprint Topology Screen
* Deployments screen
* Deployment Topology screen
* Deployment Network Topology screen
* Deployment Events screen
* Deployment Performance Metrics screen
