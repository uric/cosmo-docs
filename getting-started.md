# Before you start
## Install Python on your laptop

Cloudify CLI requires Python. If you don't have Python installed, [download python](http://www.python.org/getit/).
Windows users might want to [read about using Python with Windows](http://docs.python.org/2/using/windows.html)

ANother prerequisite is [PIP install - the Python package manager](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html)

Now you are ready to install the CLI

## Cloudify CLI overview
### Providers
A provider is any platform which allows for the creation and bootstrapping of a management server (e.g. Openstack). The CLI can work with any provider once the appropriate extension has been installed. A provider extension is provider-specific code which handles environment-related operations such as bootstrap and teardown.

Note that the CLI can be used even without the installation of any providers - if you already possess a bootstrapped management server, you may simply direct the CLI to work with that server (`cfy use <management-ip> -a my-server`), and you can then issue any of the CLI commands to that server (with the exception of the "cfy teardown" command)
#### Creating a new provider extension:
Provider extensions are simply Python modules which adhere to certain conventions and implement a certain interface.  

By convention, the module name is called "cloudify_<provider-name>.py". While any name is viable in practice, the CLI **cfy init** command, which receives a '*provider*' parameter, is set to first search for a module named by the convention, and only search for the exact '*provider*' value given if such a module was not found.

Every provider extention is expected to implement the following interface:

  - **init**(*logger*, *target_directory*, *config_file_name*, *defaults_config_file_name*)  
    this method is used to create the two configuration files with the supplied names at the given target directory, as well as make any other initializations required by the specific provider
  
  - **bootstrap**(*logger*, *config*)  
    this method is used to bootstrap the management server as well as the environment (e.g. network) in which it resides. The method must then __return the IP of the bootstrapped management server__
  
  - **teardown**(*logger*, *management_ip*)  
    this method is used to tear down the server at the address supplied, as well as any environment objects related to the server which will no longer be of use.

####Currently Supported Providers:
* [Openstack](https://github.com/CloudifySource/cloudify-openstack/tree/develop)

### Working-Directory Settings and Configurations

When running the CLI **cfy init** command, a ".cloudify" file will be created in the target directory. All local settings (such as the default management server and aliases) are stored in that file, and only take effect when using the CLI from the target directory.

Additionally to creating the ".cloudify" file, the **cfy init** command will also create two provider-specific configuration files, "cloudify-config.yaml" and "cloudify-config.defaults.yaml". These files are only required for the **cfy bootstrap** command (which expects to find these files by their default names, but may also accept paths as parameters).

All initial configuration parameters in "cloudify-config.yaml" are mandatory fields that must be supplied by the user. "cloudify-config.defaults.yaml", on the other hand, stores more advanced configuration parameters.  
The values of "cloudify-config.defaults.yaml" are only considered if missing from "cloudify-config.yaml", and therefore they can be modified either in-place or simply overridden by assigning different values to them in "cloudify-config.yaml".

Note: If the Cloudify working directory is also a git repository, it's recommended to add ".cloudify" to the .gitignore file.

# Install Cloudify on your laptop using Vagrant

# Install Cloudify on OpenStack or DevStack

## Using the Cloudify CLI
**1. Installing the CLI and a provider extension:**
  - Install Cloudify CLI (temporary url, will be on PyPI soon):  
  `pip install https://github.com/CloudifySource/cosmo-cli/archive/develop.zip`

  - Install a Cloudify provider extension (Openstack is used in this example):  
  `pip install https://github.com/CloudifySource/cloudify-openstack/archive/develop.zip`

<br>
**2. Initializing:**
  - Cd into your favorite working directory and initialize Cloudify for some provider:  
  `cfy init openstack`

  - Edit the autogenerated provider-specific config file "cloudify-config.yaml" - update its mandatory settings as needed.  
    You may also modify the more advanced default settings in "cloudify-config.defaults.yaml", or simply override them by assigning to them different values in "cloudify-config.yaml".  
    (For more information about the configuration files parameters used in this example, view the [Cloudify-Openstack readme](https://github.com/CloudifySource/cloudify-openstack/blob/develop/README.md))

  - Bootstrap cloudify on Openstack:  
  `cfy bootstrap`  
  This could take a bit of time to finish... Looking for something to do in the meanwhile? http://dynamic.xkcd.com/random/comic/



# Deploy your first application

  - Upload your blueprint:  
  `cfy blueprints upload my-app/blueprint.yaml -a my-blueprint`

  - Create a deployment of the blueprint:  
  `cfy deployments create my-blueprint -a my-deployment`

  - Execute an install operation on the deployment:  
  `cfy deployments execute install my-deployment`

This will install your deployment - all you have left to do is sit back and watch the events flow by until the deployment is complete.
